# Weapon Detection with Transfer Learning
In this project we attempt to use a pretrained YOLOv5 model to detect weapons in various scenarios.  
Class project as part of ee046211 - Deep Learning course @ Technion.  
In collaboration with Alon Nemirovsky.  

Based on [ari-dasci/OD-WeaponDetection dataset](https://github.com/ari-dasci/OD-WeaponDetection)
